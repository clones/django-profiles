==================
User profile views
==================


This application provides four views related to the creation, editing
and display of user profiles, which cover most aspects of the common
case of using profiles. All of these views are configurable to varying
extents via keyword arguments.


``profiles.views.create_profile``
=================================

Create a profile for the user, if one doesn't already exist.

If the user already has a profile, as determined by
``request.user.get_profile()``, a redirect will be issued to the
``profiles.views.edit_profile`` view. If no profile model has been
specified in the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting,
``django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable`` will be raised.

To specify the form class used for profile creation, pass it as the
keyword argument ``form_class``; if this is not supplied, it will fall
back to ``form_for_model`` for the model specified in the
``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting.

If you are supplying your own form class, it must define a method
named ``save()`` which corresponds to the signature of ``save()`` on
``form_for_model``, because this view will call it with
``commit=False`` and then fill in the relationship to the user (which
must be via a field on the profile model named ``user``, a requirement
already imposed by ``User.get_profile()``) before finally saving the
profile object. If many-to-many relations are involved, the convention
established by ``form_for_model`` of looking for a ``save_m2m()``
method on the form is used, and so your form class should define this
method.

To specify a URL to redirect to after successful profile creation,
pass it as the keyword argument ``success_url``; this will default to
the URL of the ``profiles.views.profile_detail`` view for the new
profile if unspecified.

To specify the template to use, pass it as the keyword argument
``template_name``; this will default to
``profiles/create_profile.html`` if unspecified.

Context:

    form
        The profile-creation form.

Template:

    ``template_name`` keyword argument, or
    ``profiles/create_profile.html``.


``profiles.views.edit_profile``
===============================

Edit a user's profile.

If the user does not already have a profile (as determined by
``User.get_profile()``), a redirect will be issued to the
``profiles.views.create_profile`` view; if no profile model has been
specified in the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting,
``django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable`` will be raised.

To specify the form class used for profile editing, pass it as the
keyword argument ``form_class``; this form class must have a
``save()`` method which will save updates to the profile object. If
not supplied, this will default to ``form_for_instance`` for the
user's existing profile object.

To specify the URL to redirect to following a successful edit, pass it
as the keyword argument ``success_url``; this will default to the URL
of the ``profiles.views.profile_detail`` view if not supplied.

To specify the template to use, pass it as the keyword argument
``template_name``; this will default to ``profiles/edit_profile.html``
if not supplied.

Context:

    form
        The form for editing the profile.
    
    profile
        The user's current profile.
    
Template:
    
    ``template_name`` keyword argument or
    ``profiles/edit_profile.html``.


``profiles.views.profile_detail``
=================================

Detail view of a user's profile.

If no profile model has been specified in the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE``
setting, ``django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable`` will
be raised.

If the user has not yet created a profile, ``Http404`` will be raised.

If a field on the profile model determines whether the profile can be
publicly viewed, pass the name of that field as the keyword argument
``public_profile_field``; that attribute will be checked before
displaying the profile, and if it does not return a ``True`` value,
the ``profile`` variable in the template will be ``None``. As a
result, this field must be a ``BooleanField``.

To specify the template to use, pass it as the keyword argument
``template_name``; this will default to
``profiles/profile_detail.html`` if not supplied.

Context:

    profile
        The user's profile, or ``None`` if the user's profile is not
        publicly viewable (see the note about ``public_profile_field``
        above).

Template:

    ``template_name`` keyword argument or
    ``profiles/profile_detail.html``.


``profiles.views.profile_list``
===============================

List of user profiles.

If no profile model has been specified in the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE``
setting, ``django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable`` will
be raised.

If a field on the profile model determines whether the profile can be
publicly viewed, pass the name of that field as the keyword argument
``public_profile_field``; the ``QuerySet`` of profiles will be
filtered to include only those on which that field is ``True`` (as a
result, this field must be a ``BooleanField``).

This view is a wrapper around the
``django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list`` generic view, so any
arguments which are legal for that view will be accepted, with the
exception of ``queryset``, which will always be set to the default
``QuerySet`` of the profile model, optionally filtered as described
above.

Template:

    ``template_name`` keyword argument or
    ``profiles/profile_list.html``.

Context:

    Same as the ``django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list``
    generic view.
